**Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning**

This project focuses on classifying breast cancer cases as benign or malignant using machine learning techniques. The project was developed after completing a Python course and applying concepts learned through online tutorials.

The model is implemented using Python and the TensorFlow–Keras API for building and training a neural network. Data preprocessing, splitting, and evaluation are performed using NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

**Technologies Used**:
Python,
TensorFlow & Keras,
NumPy,
Pandas,
Scikit-learn,
Google Colab.

**How to Run**:

1.Open the provided Google Colab notebook link

2.Run all cells sequentially

3.Observe training accuracy, loss, and classification results

**Objective**:
To demonstrate practical application of machine learning concepts for healthcare-related data classification.
